# Cirrhosis Prediction

## Business Problem
Cirrhosis is an advanced liver condition caused by various liver diseases, including hepatitis and chronic alcoholism. A Mayo Clinic trial focused on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) collected data from 424 patients referred to the clinic over ten years. Among them, 312 patients took part in a randomized drug trial, while the remaining 112 patients consented to basic measurements and survival monitoring. However, six of the latter group were lost to follow-up, leaving data on 106 non-participating cases and the 312 participants in the randomized trial. Our goal is to predict the Stage of Cirrhosis the Patient is in.
